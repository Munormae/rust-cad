/// The window is a building element that is predominately used to provide
/// natural light and fresh air. It includes vertical opening but also
/// horizontal opening such as skylights or light domes. It includes
/// constructions with swinging, pivoting, sliding, or revolving panels and
/// fixed panels. A window consists of a lining and one or several panels.
///
/// The IfcWindow defines a particular occurrence of a window inserted in the
/// spatial context of a project. A window can:
///
/// * be inserted into an IfcOpeningElement using the IfcRelFillsElement
///   relationship, then the IfcWindow has an inverse attribute FillsVoids provided,
/// * be part of an element assembly, often an IfcCurtainWall, using the
///   IfcRelAggregates relationship, then the inverse attribute Decomposes is provided.
/// * or be a "free standing" window, then the IfcWindow has no inverse
///   attributes FillsVoids or Decomposes provided.
///
/// Note: View definitions or implementer agreements may restrict the
/// relationship to only include one window (or door) into one opening.
///
/// There are two entities for window occurrences:
///
/// * IfcWindowStandardCase used for all occurrences of windows, that have a
///   'Profile' shape representation defined to which a set of shape parameters
///   for lining and framing properties apply. Additionally it requires the
///   provision of an IfcWindowType that references one IfcWindowLiningProperties
///   and on to many IfcWindowPanelProperties.
/// * IfcWindow used for all other occurrences of windows, particularly for
///   windows having only 'Brep', or 'SurfaceModel' geometry without applying
///   shape parameters.
///
/// The actual parameter of the window and/or its shape is defined at the
/// IfcWindow as the occurrence definition (or project instance), or by the
/// IfcWindowType as the specific definition (or project type). The following
/// parameters are given:
///
/// * at the IfcWindow or IfcWindowStandardCase for occurrence specific
///   parameters. The IfcWindow specifies:
///   * the window width and height
///   * the window opening direction (by the y-axis of the ObjectPlacement)
///
/// * at the IfcWindowType to which the IfcWindow is related by the inverse
///   relationship IsDefinedBy pointing to IfcRelDefinesByType, for type
///   parameters common to all occurrences of the same type.
///   * the partitioning type (single panel, double panel, tripel panel, more panels)
///   * the operation type (swing, tilt and turn, pivot revolve, fixed case ment, etc.)
///   * the window panel hinge side (by using two different styles for right and left opening windows)
///   * the construction material type
///   * the particular attributes for the lining by the IfcWindowLiningProperties
///   * the particular attributes for the panels by the  IfcWindowPanelProperties
///
