/// The door is a building element that is predominately used to provide
/// controlled access for people and goods. It includes constructions with
/// hinged, pivoted, sliding, and additionally revolving and folding operations.
/// A door consists of a lining and one or several panels.
///
/// The IfcDoor defines a particular occurrence of a door inserted in the spatial
/// context of a project. A door can:
///
/// * be inserted as a filler in an opening using the IfcRelFillsElement
///   relationship, then the IfcDoor has an inverse attribute FillsVoids provided;
/// * be part of an element assembly, in general an IfcCurtainWall, using the
///   IfcRelAggregates relationship, then the IfcDoor has an inverse attribute
///   Decomposes is provided;
/// * be a "free standing" door, then the IfcDoor has no inverse attributes
///   FillsVoids or Decomposes provided.
///
/// There are two main representations for door occurrences:
///
/// * IfcDoor with a shape representation having
///   RepresentationIdenfifier='Profile' is used for all occurrences of doors,
///   that have a 'Profile' shape representation defined to which a set of shape
///   parameters for lining and framing properties apply. Additionally it requires
///   the provision of an IfcDoorType that references one IfcDoorLiningProperties
///   and one to many IfcDoorPanelProperties;
///
/// * IfcDoor with other shape representations an no assiged
///   IfcDoorLiningProperties and IfcDoorPanelProperties is used for all other
///   occurrences of doors, particularly for doors having only 'Brep', or
///   'SurfaceModel' geometry without applying shape parameters.
///
/// The actual parameters of the door and/or its shape are defined by the
/// IfcDoor as the object occurrence definition, or by the IfcDoorType as the
/// object type definition. The following parameters are provided:
///
/// * at the IfcDoor for occurrence specific parameters. The IfcDoor specifies:
///   * the door width and height
///   * the door opening direction (by the y-axis of the ObjectPlacement)
/// * at the IfcDoorType, to which the IfcDoor is related by the inverse
///   relationship IsTypedBy pointing to IfcRelDefinesByType, for type parameters
///   common to all occurrences of the same type.
///    * the operation type (single swing, double swing, revolving, etc.)
///    * the door hinge side (by using two different styles for right and left
///      opening doors)
///    * the construction material type
///    * the particular attributes for the lining by the IfcDoorLiningProperties
///    * the particular attributes for the panels by the IfcDoorPanelProperties
///
/// The geometric representation of IfcDoor is given by the
/// IfcProductDefinitionShape, allowing multiple geometric representations.
/// The IfcDoor may get its parameter and shape from the IfcDoorType. If an
/// IfcRepresentationMap (a block definition) is defined for the IfcDoorType,
/// then the IfcDoor inserts it through the IfcMappedItem.
///
/// The geometric representation of IfcDoor is defined using the following
/// (potentially multiple) IfcShapeRepresentation's for its
/// IfcProductDefinitionShape:
///
/// * Profile: A 'Curve3D' consisting of a single losed curve defining the
///   outer boundary of the door (lining). The door parametric representation
///   uses this profile in order to apply the door lining and panel parameter.
///   If not provided, the profile of the IfcOpeningElement is taken.
/// * FootPrint: A 'GeometricCurveSet', or 'Annotation2D' representation
///   defining the 2D shape of the door
/// * Body: A 'SweptSolid', 'SurfaceModel', or 'Brep' representation defining
///   the 3D shape of the door.
///
/// In addition the parametric representation of a (limited) door shape is
/// available by applying the parameters from IfcDoorType referencing
/// IfcDoorLiningProperties and IfcDoorPanelProperties. The purpose of the
/// parameter is described at those entities and below (door opening operation
/// by door type). The overall size of the IfcDoor to be used to apply the
/// lining or panel parameter provided by the IfcDoorType is determined by the
/// IfcShapeRepresentation with the RepresentationIdentifier = 'Profile'.
