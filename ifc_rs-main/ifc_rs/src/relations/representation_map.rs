/// An IfcRepresentationMap defines the base definition (also referred to as block, cell or macro)

/// system in which the MappedRepresentation is defined.
///
///   NOTE  Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-43:1992 A representation map is the
///   identification of a representation and a representation item in that representation for the
///   purpose of mapping. The representation item defines the origin of the mapping. The
///   representation map is used as the source of a mapping by a mapped item.
///
/// The RepresentationMap is used through an IfcMappeditem in one or several
/// IfcShapeRepresentation's. An Cartesian transformation operator can be applied to transform the
/// MappedRepresentation into the placement coordinate system of the shape representation. The
/// transformation of the representation map is restricted to be a Cartesian transformation mapping
/// (translation, rotation, mirroring and scaling).
///
///   NOTE  The definition of a mapping which is used to specify a new representation item
///   comprises a representation map and a mapped item entity. Without both entities, the mapping
///   is not fully defined. Two entities are specified to allow the same source representation to
///   be mapped into multiple new representations.
///
///   NOTE  Entity adapted from representation_map defined in ISO 10303-43.
