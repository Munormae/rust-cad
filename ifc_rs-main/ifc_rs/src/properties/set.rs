/// The IfcPropertySet is a container that holds properties within a property tree. These
/// properties are interpreted according to their name attribute. Each individual property has a
/// significant name string. Some property sets are included in the specification of this standard
/// and have a predefined set of properties indicated by assigning a significant name. These
/// property sets are listed under "property sets" within this specification. Property sets
/// applicable to certain objects are listed in the object specification. The naming convention
/// "Pset_Xxx" applies to all those property sets that are defined as part of this specification
/// and it shall be used as the value of the Name attribute.
///
/// In addition any user defined property set can be captured. Property sets that are not declared
/// as part of the IFC specification shall have a Name value not including the "Pset_" prefix.
///
/// IfcPropertySet can be assigned to object occurrences and object types. An IfcPropertySet
/// assigned to an object type is shared among all occurrences of the same object type.
///
/// NOTE  See IfcRelDefinesByType for how to override property sets assigned to an object type
/// within the object occurrence. An IfcPropertySetTemplate may define the underlying structure,
/// i.e. the required name, the applicable object or object types to which the property set can be
/// attached, and the individual properties that can be included. Property sets are related to
/// other objects by using the relationship object that refers to the corresponding object:
